# e-algo-tc
these are my solutions for algorithm test for Eigen.

## how to run 
1. for `cpp` file, simply run the binary. e.g. `./one`
2. for `py` file, run `python3 <file_name>.py`

all of these solutions' inputs are hardcoded, but you may try to input your own test cases by uncommenting the codes within each solution.
